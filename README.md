# customVP - custom Video Platform
What does this do? It allows for a plex-like home streaming service, however it can be broken down very easily into multiple servers, with authentication, serving of files for shows, transcoding, and general processing for databases all handled independently on their own servers - with the frontend server being entirely separate.

Why do this? This allows for you to have as many streaming, and transcoding servers as you want! With easy configurability and easy growth as the goal.
